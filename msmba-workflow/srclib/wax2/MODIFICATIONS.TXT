Note:

Some WAX files have been updated here for use in MWP.

Changes include the addition off files necessary to use modern wxPython classes, not available when Wax was written
Also modifications that let wax work with current wxPython implementations

Becausee Wax is not under active development submitting these changes has not been attempted.  Consider the directory a (Very minor) fork, where updates
pertain only to those classes used in MWP.
